      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "In years past the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology has conducted\n",
      "several expeditions to the coast of southeastern Alaska, covering in\n",
      "all a large part of that district, and one to Vancouver Island, British\n",
      "Columbia, nearby and of somewhat similar character.1 As one result\n",
      "of this field work the Museum has obtained a representative collection\n",
      "of the birds and mammals of this strongly characterized northwestern\n",
      "coast region of North America. Of the closely adjacent interior of\n",
      "British Columbia, however, the Museum contained no specimens\n",
      "whatever. â€¢\n",
      "In a general way it has been understood that the faunas of the\n",
      "coast and of the interior are markedly different, that the boundary\n",
      "between the two is sharply defined, and that this boundary lies very\n",
      "near to the coast. It is obvious that collections could be made over a\n",
      "relatively limited area and still include a strip of country extending\n",
      "from the one region to the other. Such an expedition would supply\n",
      "series of specimens of species new to the Museum collections or but\n",
      "scantily represented therein, and would also provide valuable data\n",
      "regarding distribution, especially with respect to the behavior of animal\n",
      "forms at the margins of their habitats.\n",
      "The valley of the Stikine River seemed to satisfy all requirements.\n",
      "It crosses the boundary between the two f aunal areas, and, piercing the\n",
      "formidable barrier of mountains that intervenes, affords a feasible\n",
      "route from one region to the other. Furthermore, we already had\n",
      "extensive series of birds and mammals from the country about the\n",
      "mouth of the river, to supplement whatever collections might be made\n",
      "farther up stream. Dr. J. A. Allen (1903) had published a report\n",
      "upon a collection of mammals from the upper Stikine region, made\n",
      "by A. J. Stone and M. P. Anderson, but this collection had been\n",
      "gathered to the eastward of the debatable strip that we especially\n",
      "desired to explore.\n",
      "The expedition thus outlined was made possible through the generous provision by Miss Annie M. Alexander, founder of the Museum\n",
      "of Vertebrate Zoology, of a sufficient sum to defray the cost, this in\n",
      "i Previous field work on the northwest coast has been prosecuted as follows:\n",
      "in 1906 on the Kenai Peninsula; in 1907 in the Sitkan district; in 1908 in the\n",
      "Prince William Sound region; in 1909 in the Sitkan district; and in 1910 on\n",

      "addition to her regular yearly appropriation for the maintenance of\n",
      "the Museum. Miss Alexander had long been especially interested in\n",
      "the natural history of Alaska and British Columbia and had herself\n",
      "personally participated in previous field work carried on in those regions by this Museum.\n",
      "Our party consisted of two, the writer and Mr. Joseph Dixon,\n",
      "Economic Mammalogist of the Museum. Mr. Dixon collected most of\n",
      "the mammals and took entire charge of the photographic work, making this an important feature of the trip. He also supplied most of\n",
      "the notes regarding the nesting activities of various species of birds.\n",
      "The writer collected most of the birds, and worked with the mammals\n",
      "enough to enable him to better understand local conditions. The\n",
      "material collected consists of 534 mammals, 638 birds, 24 sets of birds'\n",
      "eggs (mostly with nests), 70 amphibians, 195 photographic negatives.\n",
      "The present report is concerned with the mammals and birds; the\n",
      "amphibians are not included.\n",
      "In treating the birds I have followed the nomenclature of the\n",
      "American Ornithologists' Union Check-List (1910) and its supplements (1912, 1920), with some modifications. I have made no attempt\n",
      "to be \"up to date\" in the adoption of the scores of changes proposed\n",
      "of recent years, not yet acted upon by the Committee and regarding\n",
      "which I have no new facts to offer or upon which I cannot form an\n",
      "independent opinion. There are certain cases, however, dealing mostly\n",
      "with matters of ornithology rather than nomenclature, where the presentation of new facts or a new point of view, or the conviction of\n",
      "the correctness of the course of some previous writer, 'at variance with\n",
      "the Check-List, impels me to the use of names not included in that\n",
      "standard. This, it seems to me, is proper. These changes are thus\n",
      "formally presented for consideration, but their general adoption by\n",
      "others prior to action of the Committee is not expected, any more than\n",
      "I, myself, expect at once to adopt other changes regarding. which I\n",
      "can have no personal knowledge. I have endeavored in every case at\n",

      "enclosing walls are sheer cliffs of basaltic rock, several hundred feet\n",
      "high, with long steep taluses extending below, sometimes to the river's\n",

      "sometimes in almost pure stands with but a sprinkling of other trees,\n",
      "and for miles in extent. In swampy places willow thickets form dense\n",
      "growths that are hard to penetrate. On some of the drier ridges\n",
      "these willows form open woods that are quite easy to traverse, composed of rather large trees, widely spaced and with little brush below.\n",

      "just like these, but on the other hand, autumnal females much resembling them\n",
      "(probably young birds of the year?) are common in our series.\n",
      "For comparison with hyemalis, the form to which I believe connectens is most nearly related, I have had an abundance of non-breeding birds from various places in the eastern United States, and a few\n",

      "glance, in the field, there was no doubt in my mind that hyemalis\n",
      "was the form encountered. Comparison with eastern birds, however,\n",
      "shows certain appreciable differences. Connectens is darker colored\n",
      "throughout, and, compared with the more uniformly slaty hued\n",
      "hyemalis, is seen to possess a blackish head, quite sharply defined at a\n",
      "line above the shoulders. Beneath, in connectens, the outline of the\n",
      "black breast is convex against the white belly, forming a sharp angle\n",

      "three forms arranged in parallel rows, the differences are readily\n",
      "noticeable. The black-headed appearance of the male is a feature that\n",
      "is conspicuous in the live bird.\n",
      "The female of connectens is, as a rule, more nearly like the female\n",
      "of a subspecies of the black-headed Junco oreganus group than like\n",
      "female hyemalis. The sides are more or less tinged with pink (often\n",

      "was nearly finished by noon of the. second day after it was begun.\n",

      "strutting about and exhibiting his beauties to his mate. Considering\n",

      "superfluous performance, but at any rate the one bird was hopping\n",
      "excitedly about from branch to branch, while the other sat still and\n",
      "looked on. The active performer kept the tail partly spread, wings\n",
      "drooping, and crest raised, and the whole body was held stiffly upright.\n",
      "After several minutes the other seemed to tire of the performance and\n",
      "flew away, followed at once by its mate.\n",
      "Waxwings were seen feeding on insects and also on berries and other\n",

PACIFIC RAILWAY ROUTE\\nBRITISH  COLUMBIA,    lit\\nTo The Hon. Senators and Members of the Bouse of Com\\nmons:\\nAs the important question of Pacific Railway Route iu British\\nColumbia is likely to occupy the attention of Parliament, I have\\nthought it advisable to prepare a sketch map of that Province, shewing\\nthe different Routes that are likely to4)e considered, and the position of\\nthe most prominent places mentioned in the several Reports issued\\nfrom the Public Works Department on the subject.\\nThe map is devoid of Topography and other detail, in order that\\nthe relative position of the different Routes may strike the eye at a\\nglance,\\n1! trust it may be found of some use, and cause a saving of time to\\nthose who consider the subject worthy of study.\\nIt will be found on refeiring to the last Report of 1.-78, submitted\\nto the Minister of Public Works April 26th of that year, that the\\nquestion of Route narrowed itself down to a choice of two, one terminating at Esquimalt or Vancouver\\'s Island, and the other at Burrard\\nInlet, provided it was not thought advisable to make further surveys of\\na northern line through the Peace River Oountrv to Fort Simpson ; and\\nMr. Fleming after reviewing the two Routes, comes to this conclusion : â€”\\n\" Upon carefully viewing the engineering features of each, route, and weighing\\nevery commercial consideration, I am forced to the conclusion that, if these alone\\nare to govern a sejection, if a decision cannot lie postponed until further examinations he made, if .the construction of the Railway must he at once proceeded\\nwith, the line to Vancouver Island should, for the present, he rejected, and that\\nthe Government should select the route hy the Rivers Thompson, and Fraser to\\nBurrard Inlet.\\'\\'\\nIn accordance with this recommendation, made after eight years\\nof survey, conducted by most able engineers, at a cost, in the aggregate,\\nof nearly three millions of dollars, I am informed that the late Government, by Order in Council, decided to adopt the Fraser River Route,\\n-mss-J terminating at Burrard Inlet, and called for tenders for a section 125\\nmiles in length, from Yale to Savana Ferry.\\nI presume, after mature consideration, they found that the cost of\\nsurveys that would be required to place the Northern Route in a position\\nto make a comparison of distance,  grades,  and   cost  witn   the   Fraser\\nRiver Route, would be  so enormous, and   the   chances  of   finding  a\\npracticable line so remote, that it was thought unadvisable to prosecute\\nthem, although Mr. Fleming stated in his report:â€”\\n\" If, therefore, this northern line is to be seriously considered, it is indispen-\\nsahle that a thorough survey he made of it. With our present knowledge, it will\\nbe unwise to adopt it as the route for the Railway and to determine on proceeding\\nwith construction, without obtaining full and complete information regarding it.\\nMy own opinion is in favor of gaining information, and if the Government\\nentertain this view, I beg leave to suggest that during the pres-\\'nt year a continu-\\n. ous exploration be made from Port Simpson, eastwards, to a point of junction with\\nthe located line in the neighborhood of Lake Winnepegoosis.\"\\nMy own impression is that the Government adopted a wise course\\nin abandoning further surveys in that northern country, and in refusing to\\nentertain the advice of Mr.-Marcus Smith to commence work on a\\nRoute, information about which was so meagre, and which led to a\\nterminus, the disadvantages of which, as against Burrard Inlet, increased when connected with a point nearly 300 miles north of Yellow\\nHead Pass.\\nFrom explorations I have myself made in the cou\\' try west of the\\'\\nRocky Mountains for the Local Government of British Columbia, and\\nthrough which a line to reach Fort Simpson must pass, I am convinced\\nthat many seasons must be spent in surveys before an intelligent comparison can be made with other routes, and, I believe, with a verv poor\\nchance of ultimately obtaining a practicable line.\\nThe -arguments in favor of the adoption of the Fraser River\\nRoute, with Burrard Inlet as the terminus, and which led to a thorough\\nlocation survey of that line being made, have turned out to be unmis\\ntakaoly correct, as the facts and figures in the report of Mr. Sandford\\nFleming of 1878 prove.\\nThe plans and profiles shew a saving in distance of 300 miles over\\nthe Bute Inlet Route; grades greatly superior, as will be seen by\\nreferring to the map, two summits on the Bute Inlet Route having to\\nbe crossed at an altitude of 3,505 ft. and 3,610 ft., both within a,\\nfew feet as  high  as the   Rocky Mountain   summit;  the  amount  of curvature on the line is slightly in favor of the Fraser River Route, and\\nthe cost of construction $20,000,000 less, with the addition ol a fifteen\\nmile ferry.\\nThe facility for carrying on the work of construction on that Route,\\nas compared with Bute Inlet Route, is so great that it is estimated that\\na deduction of at least 12 per ce-ut. should be made on the cost of all\\nworks on this Route below formation leveL\\nBy no other route can the Canadian Pacific Railway be expected\\'\\nto draw traffic from Puget Sound,. Washington, or Oregon. Territory, or\\nto divide with California the Touiists\\' travel, which is a large source of\\nrevenue to the American lines.\\nIn reference to the Harbor of Burrard Inlet, at which the line, as-\\nadopted by the late Government, terminates, there appears to be a*\\ngreat misconception in some quarters as tofts extent and. capabilities,\\nand althtxigh the prefe ence has been given to it by a large majority of\\nthe best naval authorities-, I see, in some newspapers, that Esqui.malt is\\nreferred to as the best Harbor on the eoast north of San Francisco. I\\nhave consequently prepared a sketch shewing the relative sizes of\"\\nEsqnimalt and Burrard Inlet Harbors.\\nBy referring to the map it will be seea that Burrard Inlet is, in.\\nsuperficial area, twenty-five times the size of Esquimalt, with g\\'>od\\nanchorage almost all war it, and could give a dockage of about fifteen\\nmiles at a light cost, by bringing the line of Railway along the south\\nshore of the Inlet from Port Moody to Coal Harbor ; in fact if we are\\never to have a terminus on our coast rJhat is to command a commerce\\nsuch ai we have a rigir to expect, it cannot be done at Esquimalt, for\\nthere is no room.\\nSome objections have also been made 1o the navigation to reach\\nBurrard Inlet and Bute Inletr and Mr. Marcus Smith states in his\\nreport of laso year : \" A list is before me of over sixty marine disasters-\\nthat have occurred in these waters within a few years.\"\\nThe following is an extract on the question of the navigation to\\nBurrard Inlet sent me by Mr. Hugh Nelson, formerly M.P. for New\\nWestminster, one of the members of the Moody Milling Co., Burrard\\nInlet. A perusal of it will shew that the navigation to that Inlet wilL\\ncompare favorably with any port in.the world. mmmmmmm\\nMr. Nelson should  be a good authority on this subject, having\\nresided at Burrard Inlet for the last fifteen years,  and been directly\\ninterested in its shipping :\\nMoodyyille, February 7th, 1879.\\nMy Dear Dewuney,â€”I am just in receipt of yours of the 8th January, and am\\nsorry to say, in reply, that I am unable to send you full list of vessels that have\\nvisited Burrard Inlet for cargoes of lumber tor foreign ports. I have tried a\\nnumber of times to get the vessels sent away bv the Hastings Mill Co., and they\\nhave either not kept a record or are not inclined to be communicative, and until\\nthe time of (Jlarkson\\'s appointment to the Customs here, no record was kept by\\nthis department. I do, however, send you a list of all the vessels that have\\nvisited our own mill up to the present date, with their registered tonnage. For\\nthe first few years the tonnage is closely approximate, as we only kept a list of the\\nnames of the vessels and the amount ot lumber taken by them, and as there were\\nonly a few vessels prior to 1868, I include, in the number and tonnage for th&t\\nyear, not only what properly belongs to it, but also those of the preceding three\\nyears:â€”\\nVessels   21,000 Registered Tons.\\nÂ«          15.000 \"\\n1868...\\n...36\\n1869\\t\\n22\\n1870\\t\\n... 14\\n1871....\\n... 19\\n1872\\t\\n... 17\\n1873 ...\\nf>0\\n1874\\t\\n... 18\\n1875....\\n99\\n1876\\t\\n22\\n1877\\t\\n... 29\\n1878\\t\\n... 25\\nO\\n10,000\\n12,000\\n9.000\\n16.000\\n13,500\\n15,600\\n17,000\\n19,500\\n19.655\\n3,463\\n250 Ships. 171.718 Reg. Tons.\\nMaking in all 250 ships with an average registered tonnage of about 687 tons.\\nIn addition to these, there have been, of course, a large number of coasting\\nschooners, steamers, &c., &c. Out ot this large number of ships the only vessel\\nthat was lost in British Columbia waters was the barque \" Rosalia,\" in 1868, and\\nshe was cast adrift while in tow of the steamer -Isabel,\" without time having\\nbeen given her to set a sail, and was consequently blown ashore on Discovery\\nIsland. The\" only vessel lost on voyage to the mill, in British Columbia waters,\\nwas the barque \" Lunalillo,\\' in Royal Roads, off Esquimalt Harbor, blown ashore\\nfrom her achorage almost at the same spot as. the Htidson\\'s Bay barque \" Lady\\nLamson\" went ashore, after being wrecked on Bcragg\\'s Rocks, at entrance to\\nEsquimalt Harbor. The only oth*r vessel leaving our mill that received\\ndamages necessitating the discharge of any portion of her cargo was the barque\\n\" Ruby,1\\' that also went\\'ashore in Royal Roads, and had to be taken into Esquimalt, a portion of her cargo discharged, and receive repairs. Not a single vessel\\nof any tonnage ever received damage either coming in through the narrows or\\ngoing out, necessitating repairs to the extent of one hundred dollars, and yet these\\nnarrows are represented as the great bug-bear.\\nBefore the next mail, I will try again to get a list from the Hastings people,\\nand if successful will forward it to you, but failing success, I suppose it would be\\nfair to assume that a like number of ships have visited their mill, making in all\\n5i\\'0 ships, say, in a period of ten years, witii an average registered tonnage of\\nnearly 700 tons each, and only two ships lost on their outward voyage in British\\nâ€¢Columbia waters, viz- \" Rosalia \" and Â« Cornelius,\" A claim has been put forward that Burrard Inlet is nRt an Ocean harbor. I\\nthink such a statement as the foregoing will prove the untruthfulness of this\\nslander.\\n(Signed) H. NELSON.\\nAnother advantage to the Fraser Route is that it would be an all\\nrail route, and no Ferries to cause inconvenience to traffic.\\nThe principal argurnents against the adoption of the Burrard Inlet\\nRoute are the following :â€”1st, That it runs for some few miles in close\\nproximity to the American Boundary, and that aline could be extended\\nfrom a point on ours to Holmes7 Harbor, PuÂ£,et Sound, a distance of\\nabout 60 miles, aud thus assist the Americans to build up a port and\\nvirtually take our terminus from us.\\nI think thaf. objection is easily answered. It undoubtedly lies\\nwith us whether we allow a connection to be made. Our line\\nruns on the north bank of Fraser River, and a bridge of an enormously\\nexpensive character, and one that should not interfere with navigation\\nof ships drawing 12 feet of water, would have to be constructed before\\na junction eould be made with us. No obstruction should be placed in\\nthe river that would prevent the passage of Her Majesty\\'s gun-boats,\\nwhich can navigate very near the point south of which connection must\\nbe made by any line reaching a terminus in American territory.\\nIn the year I808 the Hudson Bay Company\\'s ship \" Otter,\" of\\nabout 400 tons and drawing 12 feet of water, reached that point, and the\\nmark still exists on the bluff made by the Captain on that memorable\\ntrip.\\nBy inspection of the map, the position of Holmes\\' Harbor .can be\\nseen, and it will be evident that without a canal cut through a neck of\\nland, the distaice from the ocean to reach it will not be much less\\nthan to Burrard Inlet, but I have the best authority for stating that a\\ncanal is impracticable, and was never seriously contemplated by any\\none, and 1 fear our Acting Engineer-in-Chief must have b^en hoaxed by\\nsome interested individual, as he appears to attach much importance to\\nit. Some enterprising Americans did, at three different points on\\nPusret Sound, lav off bogus town sites, and endeavored to sell lots at\\nwhat they called the Northern Pacific Terminus. One was laid\\noff at Holmes\\' Hai\\'bor, and to the uninformed, the scheme of cutting a\\ncanal looked very feasible on the map, but the whole thing was nothing\\nbut a swindling operation, got up for the purpose of taking in the\\npublic. I myself would* not object to see a connection made with the railway system of Washington and Oregon Territories. The outcry has\\nalways been on this side of the Dominion that there would be a want\\nof local traffic on the Pacific Railway. This connection would greatly\\nassist us in that particular, for I contend that the advantages of our\\nroute would be such as to command a large amount of the transcontinental traffic of the adjoining territories of the United States, even if\\nthe Northern Pacific was constructed.\\nBut there are very strong reasons for believing that the Northern\\nPacific will not be extended in a continuous line to the Pacific. The\\nbarrenness of the country west of the point to which the last contract\\nis let, the difficulties of the work as it approaches the Pacific, the high\\nsummits to be crossed, necessitating very heavy grades, the construction\\nof a line from Ogden to Portland, on the Columbia, by the Union-\\nPacific, which will secure the transcontinental traffic that the Northern\\nPacific expected to get, are among a few of the obstacles in its way.\\nThere are other arguments which should not be overlooked in-\\nfavour of our lineâ€”Customs Regulations, Bonding Fees,and other complications consequent on passing through a foreign countryâ€”and the\\nlast and not least, the advantage we have in distance on our line, it\\nbeing 400 miles in our favour irom the Pacific to Lake Superior. This-\\nalone should give us almost a monopoly of the traffic.\\n2nd. The military aspect. This objection needs but a passing\\nremark. Naval and military authorities are almost unanimous in\\nconsidering it of slight importance, for they contend that \"the country\\nthat holds naval superiority in the Straits of Fuca will control the\\ncommerce.\"    There can be no doubt about that: and unless we have it\\n\\' r\\nwe can no  more do  business at Esquimalt than we   can at Burrard\\nInlet.\\nSince writing ths above, I have noticed in the New Westminster\\nPacific Herald a very able article on this subject, and append it.\\nTrusting you will find the maps and these notes of service,\\nI remain,\\nYour obedient servant,\\nE. DEWDNEY.. Taking, first, the leading idea of all the Island contributors to the\\ndiscussion, viz., that Esquimalt must be the terminus, in order, as they\\nargue, to give the Canadian Pacific a chance to compete successfully\\nwith American transcontinental lines. Now, we think it may be stated\\nas a proposition which will admit of no dispute, that the shortest line,\\nin these go-ahead days, will naturally have the best chance in any such\\ncompetition, provided that line does not possess any serious counterbalancing disadvantage, such as great cost in constructing or heavy\\nexpense in operating. And it may also be taken for granted that th$\\nline which can be most cheaply maintained and operated will have a\\ngreat deal in its favour. Taking the question of distance first, we turn\\nto Mr. Fleming\\'s latest report, and find this:â€”\\nLet us assume, for the sake of the argument, that a railway is completed and\\nin operation to both points, Burrard Inlet and Esquimalt, and a person at Esquimalt desires to tiavel to\\'Ottawa. He has the option of crossing by steamer, 90\\nmiles, to Burrard Inlet, and then using the railway, or of taking the train at\\nEsquimalt and proceeding on his journey from that point. In the latter case\\nhe would, taking the most favourable view, have to travel some 150 mileg\\nfarther; or, if the line were carried through by Pine River Pass, fully 20Â© miles\\nmore than by way of Burrard Inlet.\\nIt is evident that even were the wide channels at the Valdes Islands bridged,\\nthe Railway carried to Esquimalt would present no advantage in time or cost to\\nan ordinary traveller. If passengers from Esquimalt could secure no benefit\\nfrom the extension of the Railway to that place, it is certain that there would be\\na loss sustained by carrying freight by the longer route.\\nThis, coming from the Chief Engineer, must be acknowledged to\\nbe exceedingly strons testimony in favor of the Fraser Route, in the\\nmatter of distance, proving, as it does, that by that route, passengers\\nand freight could most speedily perform the journey. Now, considering\\nthe question of cost, we turn again to the same report, and find this :â€”\\nThe cost of extending the Railway to Esquimalt would greatly exceed that\\nof taking it to Burrard Inlet; there are no sufficient data to form a proper estimate of the cost. But even by leaving a gap near Valdes Islands of fifteen\\nmiles, and substituting a ferry for the enormously costly bridging at that locality,\\nthe excess would probably reach $L5.000,000or $20,000,000. The cost of maintenance would be great in proportion, and the annual losses on working the\\nÂ«xtra mileage would, under the peculiar circumstances, be serious.\\nTurning now to ^Ir. H. J. Cambie\\'s carefully studied report, we\\nfind the cost of building the line to English Bay, Burrard Inlet\\nâ€¢estimated at $32,000,000, while the cost of the line to Esquimalt is\\nÂ«et down at 4$52,OO0,000, without what Mr. Fleming calls the \" enormously costly bridging\" of the Straits. We will, therefore, be well\\nâ– within the mark in â€¢estimating the cost of an all rail line to Esquimalt 8\\n(and no other would be worth a button in competition with foreign\\nlinas) at just double that of a similar line to Burrard Inlet, involving,\\nof course, a double charge for interest. In the same report, the cost of\\nmaintaining the line to Esquimalt is calculated to exceed the same\\ncharge on the line to Burrard Inlet, by $693,000 a year, including an\\nallowance for a ferry, or, say $600,000 a year for an all rail route.\\nHere, then, we have the line to Esquimalt saddled with an extra cost\\nof about $l,tf 00,000 a year, for interest and maintenance; and for\\nwhat? In order that passengers and freight may have to travel 150 or\\n200 miles farther, and arrive at their destination one or two days\\nlater! And, as Mr. Cambie justly observes, rates for through traffic\\nwill be governed by competing lines, and not by mileage. So far, then,\\neven looking at the line wholly with respect to the through trafficâ€”\\nleaving out of sight the unification of the Dominion, and the colonization of the country, for which purposes the Fraser Route is admittedly\\nunequalledâ€”we find an enormous balance of advantages in favor of the\\nline terminating at Burrard Inlet. Into what is called the military\\naspect of the question, we have not time to enter now. It can easily\\nbe shown, however, that even here the Fraser Route will compare well\\nwith its rival. Suffice it, for the present, to say that we have the\\nauthority of General Sir Selby Smythe for treating the military\\nobjections to thÂ«- Fraser Route lightly } and, even if it were otherwise,\\nwe have the authority of a thousand years of glorious memories for\\nsaying that the British Lion is little likely to go skulking up among\\nnorthern iceburgs, with his tail between his legs, scared by the shadowy\\npossibility of future danger.\\nTable of Distances from Summit of Rocky   Mountains  bo  Pacifie\\nOcean Harbors.\\nComparative\\ncost.\\nEraser    River   Route   to   Port   Moody,   Burrard Inlet, 489 miles $31,000,000>\\n\"                     Extended to Coal Harbor 501 \"\\nBute    Inlet    Route     to Esquimalt, including 15 miles\\nferry from Fredeiick Arm to Otter Cove...\\'... .?&Â» â€¢<        52,000,000>   ', 'label': 'FullText', 'iri': 'http://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#note', 'attrs': {'ns': 'http://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#note', 'lang': 'en', 'classmap': 'oc:AnnotationContainer'}}], 'DateIssued': [{'explain': 'A Dublin Core Terms Property; Date of formal issuance (e.g., publication) of the resource.', 'value': '[1879?]', 'label': 'DateIssued', 'iri': 'http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued', 'attrs': {'property': 'dcterms:issued', 'ns': 'http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued', 'lang': 'en', 'classmap': 'oc:SourceResource'}}], 'Type': [{'explain': 'A Dublin Core Terms Property; The nature or genre of the resource.; Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMITYPE].
